        "- Answer:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  NLTK is a traditional NLP toolkit focused on teaching and research, offering granular linguistic functions like stemming, parsing, and corpora access. spaCy is designed for industrial use, optimized for fast processing and modern ML pipelines. NLTK provides flexibility but requires more manual steps, while spaCy offers pretrained pipelines and high-speed operations. NLTK is easier for beginners, whereas spaCy is preferred for production deployments due to performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  TextBlob is a Python library built on top of NLTK that simplifies everyday NLP operations using a clean and high-level API. It allows sentiment analysis, noun phrase extraction, translation, tagging, and classification with only a few lines of code. It is beginner-friendly and abstracts complex NLP logic behind simple function calls. Because of this, TextBlob is useful for quick prototypes and educational applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "  Stanford NLP provides high-accuracy linguistic models based on deep learning and statistical parsing. It is used heavily in academia to benchmark syntactic and semantic understanding systems. In industry, Stanford NLP powers information extraction, document understanding, and question-answering systems. Its multilingual support and research-grade precision make it valuable where accuracy is more important than real-time speed.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  An RNN is a neural network designed for sequential data where past information needs to influence future predictions. It keeps a hidden state that stores memory from previous time steps and feeds it into the next step. This makes RNNs useful for tasks like language modeling and speech recognition. However, traditional RNNs suffer from vanishing gradients, making it difficult to learn long-term dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Question 5: What is the key difference between LSTM and GRU networks in NLP applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  LSTM and GRU are both improved RNN architectures that address long-term dependency issues. LSTM has separate input, output, and forget gates to control memory flow, while GRU combines them into a single update and reset gate. GRU trains faster due to fewer parameters and works well for smaller datasets. LSTM may perform better when long-term memory retention is critical.\n",

        "  - A mental-health chatbot requires context understanding, emotion detection, and safe responses. I would clean text using spaCy (tokenization, lemmatization, entity recognition), convert words to embeddings, and feed them into an LSTM/GRU to classify intent and emotional tone. The model would generate predefined safe responses or escalate severe messages to human support. Ethical concerns include user privacy, avoiding harmful advice, and maintaining empathetic responses.\n",
